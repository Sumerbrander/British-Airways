the usb charger ports on my seat did not work the staff were pleasant enough but their service oozed mediocrity  there did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing the food has been the worst

they then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did the food was tasteless we take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this to no avail as a family of 3 we fly british airways medium to long haul regularly possibly 46 times a year each for us the good things about

had to pay extra and dont get me started on their customer service helpline on board the staff are ok but on the long cairolondon route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers and for the flyers who dont want the hassle of charges minimal cabin service and budget seats then they could easily provide a premium economy option  and really make a difference for the experience heathrow terminal 5 compounds the poor experience especially for arrivals it is also poorly served by transport links  especially for those of us who live near gatwick which is being abandoned by ba i have been a frequent flyer for many years  and was even a ba gold card holder at one point  so i know about the potential experience i used be able to make the choice  do i fly budget or do i fly more comfortably for more now its a case of flying budget or flying budget for double the price with

please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once they have your money you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye we used them to travel to europe and it was the worst experience i have had with an airline in years when you work hard and save your money to travel you expect a good experience welp not with this company who i am sure makes millions on customers per year i understand that sometimes things happen but this started right after we booked our flight and the bad experience did not end until we set foot back to our hometown please take note 1  the customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website i had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered trust me the number is a secret 2 – when you finally find a customer service number there is a long wait and when or if someone answers they will not resolve your issues instead they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to no one takes ownership 4 what airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you the customer british

are the primary you may or may not get notifications 7  if you pay for seats and you pick them it doesn’t matter they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid 8  the

uk first the boeing 7879 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy the seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half they have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet which wakes up that passenger the whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you second the food was disgusting third the service terrible fourth the toilet was tiny fifth the inflight screen was fixed and too high so i could not see anything sixth their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and i had to pay more no free airport transfers with british airways seventh the charging points did not work the second leg to london was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle that was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece this means that you are sleeping on a metal bar the seat where there is a gap in the seat to add insult to injury i now find that both flights back to sydney are on the small plane to book a seat before check in is 170 i paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left this is why i got the worst seat in the

amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines the leather toiletry bag was quite nice though no slippers only a pair of socks the restrooms on the flight are very small and dont provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines no free wifi in business class is not acceptable another example of bas penny pinching in recent years regarding the staff and customer service poor inattentive beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight i had to go and find an attendant and ask there was also no offer of any snacks rude at times my partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty the attendant was incredibly rude in response this left us shocked different customers seem to receive a different quality of service a customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were whether they needed anything etc whereas my partner and i were not afforded the same level of personal service this is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service the food was pretty bad i had risotto while my partner had chicken both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge the vegetables were discoloured and flavourless the bread was nice though the breakfast wasnt much better summary ba has become the ryanair of long haul the

utilise cheaper slots at airports but it seems an odd choice for ba given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone outbound lgwdbv boarding was fairly quick easy and efficient and we took off on time pilot announcements clear professional and inspired confidence which is something i appreciate and expect of ba pilots aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the pinnacle seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort

presentation and behaviour  messy illfitting uniforms and unclassy makeup toilets clean and maintained appreciate antibacterial wipes being kept available postcovid inbound dbvlgw for some reason no online or app checkin available despite dubrovnik airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities no queue at manual checkin though and ground staff were very warm friendly and helpful proactively offered to take our larger handluggage into hold free of charge but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already we did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time also we travelled to dubrovnik out of season and the airport was empty at that hour with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening all the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this

declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you” she refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked

family ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft on my vielhr leg the boarding time for the a320 was over 50 minutes long leading to a delayed departure there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal 5 at heathrow boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area

explanation as i couldnt fathom how they could cancel the flight not have any other flights available and i didnt get a full refund each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service and thats where the frustration begins the customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case a month later and about 6 phone calls later thats 6 hours waiting on the phone they finally refunded me a little more  in total less than 14 of what i paid it would seem to get a refund in increments i would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until i got frustrated and give up so instead of calling i enquired about this via their website  just for an answer as to why i wasnt getting a full refund i didnt cancel my booking neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to hk after another month of waiting  this is the reason they gave in an email thanks for contacting us about your claim for eu compensation were sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to heathrow on 29 april 2022 your claims been refused because ba0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason further to your request i would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund as the same is looked after by our support team we take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision the cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule thanks again for following this up with us please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and i hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon best regards british airways customer relations i dont know what non payable commercial reason is i am out about 250 sterling going to just leave it their and boycott this

especially the purser were phenomenal extremely friendly adaptive to your needs and professional leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight sandwiches and scones were tasty i am actually a fan of wellpresented however simpler meals on board to my opinion they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust for a quick hop ba ticked all the marks here in comparison on a cdglhr leg air france presented a ‘chic’ cold starter however to me it looked a bit too complicated and except from the duck terrine rather unappetising  klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box one big drawback was the first wing experience at t5 the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead it’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers  their companies spend to earn a gold status nevertheless the flight and most importantly the crew completely negated that drawback the flight was £200 one way £600 return incl transfer to kirkwall which was pretty expensive however the service seemed like it was worth the

of starter or desert and 3 choices for main course business class seating is 242 with alternate seats facing backwards as are both the centre seats we were in those so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble you cannot see out you cannot see other passengers it was slightly better as it was my wife and myself but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger  nowhere to put a glass bottle of water book or glasses within easy reach unless you keep the table down in most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing but there is nowhere to put a bag so everything has to go in the overhead locker and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats so not much storage space we were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2 now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case but normally if as a couple you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partners legs not some stranger i am 5ft 10 and could just about manage my wife at 5ft

date how wrong i was first i had to pay to top up my flight  a significant amount equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles this was because of price increases and the fact that i was flying at peak times the extra charge also meant that i overall paid more than face value their online price at the time for the ticket for the

would have lost a lot of money to administration fees they had me in a desperate situation where i was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what i did so i cut my losses and booked the flight

booked 6 ba flights 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines the personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks that cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation a couple of weeks ago i noticed that one of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov 12th this year so i tried to speak to them as the world has largely been closed since march 20 i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher i’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline i’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and i’ve cancelled my ba amex i work in the music business managing tours for bands so i reckon i book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that roll on

was chocolate or crisps the first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention the seat would not easily convert to a bed it had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby again not what youd expect from a premium product i left my watch on the flight in error and contacted ba immediately about this despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during covid my watch was never found ba has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers given that i told them specifically where id left the watch i can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it all in all you pay premium on a flight for additional service ba isnt offering it at the moment if it is essential that you have to fly really dont bother with first unless you have to  or go to another airline the company just dont

importantly a human which is very rare nowadays carrying on i went to ba checkin but unfortunately couldn’t do it as my results didn’t go through yet however another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive i’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions and every time she was very patient professional and happy to help after i got my results i came back to heathrow on 24th but unfortunately there were no flights to cairo the situation became even more complicated i will spare the details however here again brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me the nicest lady i’ve ever met unfortunately i didn’t catch her name but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian followed me throughout my struggles offered me emotional and professional support she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i can’t thank her enough she also asked her colleague to help me which he kindly did  lastly the nice lady shame i

different ways i can stay at the airport gave his phone to call and offered to drop me off at the hotel which he did not have to do whatsoever to conclude i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects i honestly do not know what would i do if i haven’t met them i don’t know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines for some

seemed to be more than the official 31 pilots were very good and informative as always with ba quality of food on longhaul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches i rather enjoyed the meals served which were on nice large trays the ife was just about adequate though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft cathay pacifics is far superior the two major downsides 1 the new basic economy fare it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers ba really need to get rid of it virtually everyone on longhaul has to check in a bag so please just include it in all airfare types if i wanted to be nickleanddimed id fly to gatwick on a charter airline also not being able to choose a seat even at the time of checkin is infuriating i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty this just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay thankfully the lady at checkin changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely 2 no complimentary catering on shorthaul seeing as virtually all passengers flying tofrom heathrow are connecting tofrom longhaul flights with ba and have spent at least 1000 on their airfare i resented a drink and snack not being included on the shorthaul segment of my trip ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on lowcost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip if ba would get rid of these two new features i would not hesitate to fly with them again as everything else about my trip was pleasant as it is i would still consider other airlines","polarity":0.1503948052,"sentiment_tag":"positive"},{"index":532,"reviews":"hong kong to london heathrow with british airways one of

hour after the order was taken unfortunately although they were pleasant the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained i asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there werent any i showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken at the end of the flight i discovered the switch despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping i had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times there was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section i cannot understand why they  would not offer a third there was port on the menu but was never offered with cheese every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal i was ready for a mini snack i am not a big eater but i was peckish the layout of the business cabin is cramped i am 6 and i could not stretch out the seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers this means no one has a easy seat you either have to climb or be climbed over i wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market i travel on many airlines in business and ba is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one i would use the centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers unfortunately upon arrival at bridgetown the ba team didnt get any better after one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage i approached a guy wearing a ba tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders i then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac

adventure this october specifically 1031 yes thats the day called for brexit only we made our reservations before those dates were set considering ba pilots have called for three pilot strikes on september 2019 coupled with brexit we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection the good news is close to 800 in fees for our two business class tickets was refunded when i changed our flights to another carrier through american airlines advantage the bad news is the 22000 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded i called ba to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses i was just not feeling the love here so i am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly british airways all of the other outstanding carriers dont charge nearly the high fees and most dont charge for reserving your seats in advance instead of ba we changed our booking to 1030 on etihad airways through abu dhabi their customer service was outstanding the fees were lower and yes no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and i can travel next to each other i am

ever since the first day of our journey on 1st august because our two pieces of luggage were left in heathrow airport by ba staff when we took the transit flight from the uk to copenhagen we went to menzies in cph and they filed a repor we stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found they should be sent to our air bb house in marstal in cph on or before 3rd august or deliver to the hotel we stayed in cph if they were found on 4th august on 2nd august we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the ba website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match therefore we kept phoning and emailing menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so and the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset the system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th august 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves on 3rd august menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport unfortunately when we went to the cph airport on the 4th august they told us that they had already sent the found luggage to the island in marstal on 4th apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date they then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office we did find the other one by ourselves in the airport which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one they were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the ba to push them to find the baggage for us we believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up we were so confused which bag was really missing we finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in marstal to the airport and send it to the uk address which was our next destination when we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th we phoned menzies again and found out that our luggage in marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th hence we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th august before we flew to the uk however when we came to the airport again we couldnt find our luggage and the staff didnt explain why and just told us to leave if the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th how come it would disappear on the 5th the staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us this service was totally unacceptable we spnet hours parking at the

this flight was operated by comair and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe check in at the priority line was uneventful however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business johannesburg airport and cape towns domestic terminal is laid out very similarly their lounge called slow is actually impressive although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks pastries and small bites they even had a coffee counter with madetoorder drinks i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol very impressive for a domestic business class lounge priority boarding was honoured and boarding was an orderly process i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6 as there is actually tons of legroom in front i reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking these seats were old and plush however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats in a 2x3 configuration i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat there were several drink services on this two hour flight and a hot breakfast with either a bacon sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option needless to say a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh the crew were very friendly making casual jokes and giving a downtoearth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days they were quite rushed but understandable due to the short flight time in cape town airport it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplaneboard but since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737 it works and makes sense i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways and they were the same price as the competition south african airways i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africas busiest air route for the price paid id be happy to fly them again","polarity":0.0892021277,"sentiment_tag":"positive"},{"index":719,"reviews":"grenada to gatwick

found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people boarding was straightforward however and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers even in economy the flight product was just ok in my view i had an exit row aisle seat and while i had extra room and a nice headrest the seat was right by the lav so it stank ife was fine with a decent selection but it was not as complete as deltas the food was the bland equivalent of what delta serves so no brownie points there and the tea service they had was terrible we were given halfsandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages i remember years ago when ba was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile those smiles have disappeared for the most part and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there however i arrived on time and promptly got my bag the 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight

exceptions where they allow 2 and india to uscanada is one of those exceptions though it isnt clear if it applies for travel originating at either end so i am not sure if i got an extra bag or not but i did use the 2 bag allowance boarding you board in zone 3 after firstbusiness  the oneworld elites that is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage  if it doesnt fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding this means you also get off fairly quickly  which can help if youre in a hurry to get through security at heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination in flight there is a welcome drink for premium economy champagne juice water depending on the departure time there is also a hot towel service also 787 cabin the 7879 has a nicely done premium economy cabin 232 seating as opposed to 333 in economy so a somewhat wider seat seat pitch is also decent these are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats  but seat was comfortable the food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage though not much there is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor there is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf you do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades socks and toothpaste the seat back screen is large and easy to use there is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy  so not a long walk 777 cabin 777 has a 242 seating in premium economy same as club world as opposed to 333 in economy the 777 version used on the lhrblr sector has a very small premium economy cabin  just 3 rows of seats this gives it a sort of cosy feel you do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full  and i had the seat next to me vacant on both legs that helped me stretch out for sure the seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats food nothing much here i didnt think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been it was ok  nothing to write home

biting pieces off after a few hours i went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses reluctantly one stopped chattering

knackered getting out was a task in itself i bought wifi for the whole trip it ran for about 50 of the flight yet their customer non existent services refuse to refund the payment even though i sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service but they are happy to note the problems we have avoided ba now for some time except where there is no other option

get through my wife managed to check herself in online but could not check me in there was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in once my wife pressed my name the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete it was a computer glitch we couldnt get around  ultimately we arrived at the rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in my wife was ok and could go through but i could not we asked the 3 ladies at the british airways desk for help and they shrugged and said they couldnt help us apparently they said it would have been different if we called before and we showed them her phone see the attached photos with all the calls we made they then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldnt reschedule us they gave us another number to call my wife at this point was near tears i am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior so i was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs she was managing all the luggage the ticketing etc

interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call nothing could be done for us and they could only rebook us for 8800 no apologies whatsoever were given nor the slightest help or accommodation
