For this task, we are only interested in reviews related to British Airways and the Airline itself.\n\nIf you navigate to this link: [https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways] you will see this data. Now, we can use `Python` and `BeautifulSoup` to collect all the links to the reviews and then to collect the text data on each of the individual review links.","metadata":{},"id":"bd098a37-4939-43a4-8b56-b0f212576458","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport pandas as pd","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":223,"lastExecutedAt":1689280373021,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"import requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport pandas as pd"},"id":"06f2f288-5285-4b72-8fe6-e063c3469585","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"source":"base_url = \"https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways\"\npages = 10\npage_size = 100\n\nreviews = []\n\n# for i in range(1, pages + 1):\nfor i in range(1, pages + 1):\n\n    print(f\"Scraping page {i}\")\n\n    # Create URL to collect links from paginated data\n    url = f\"{base_url}/page/{i}/?sortby=post_date%3ADesc&pagesize={page_size}\"\n\n    # Collect HTML data from this page\n    response = requests.get(url)\n\n    # Parse content\n    content = response.content\n    parsed_content = BeautifulSoup(content, 'html.parser')\n    for para in parsed_content.find_all(\"div\", {\"class\": \"text_content\"}):\n        reviews.append(para.get_text())\n    \n    print(f\"   ---> {len(reviews)} total reviews\")","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":14833,"lastExecutedAt":1689280387855,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"base_url = \"https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways\"\npages = 10\npage_size = 100\n\nreviews = []\n\n# for i in range(1, pages + 1):\nfor i in range(1, pages + 1):\n\n    print(f\"Scraping page {i}\")\n\n    # Create URL to collect links from paginated data\n    url = f\"{base_url}/page/{i}/?sortby=post_date%3ADesc&pagesize={page_size}\"\n\n    # Collect HTML data from this page\n    response = requests.get(url)\n\n    # Parse content\n    content = response.content\n    parsed_content = BeautifulSoup(content, 'html.parser')\n    for para in parsed_content.find_all(\"div\", {\"class\": \"text_content\"}):\n        reviews.append(para.get_text())\n    \n    print(f\"   ---> {len(reviews)} total reviews\")"},"id":"adb6627b-c06d-4b75-b88f-7b69cc88a970","cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"Scraping page 1\n   ---> 100 total reviews\nScraping page 2\n   ---> 200 total reviews\nScraping page 3\n   ---> 300 total reviews\nScraping page 4\n   ---> 400 total reviews\nScraping page 5\n   ---> 500 total reviews\nScraping page 6\n   ---> 600 total reviews\nScraping page 7\n   ---> 700 total reviews\nScraping page 8\n   ---> 800 total reviews\nScraping page 9\n   ---> 900 total reviews\nScraping page 10\n   ---> 1000 total reviews\n"}]},{"source":"df = pd.DataFrame()\ndf[\"reviews\"] = reviews\ndf.head()","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":55,"lastExecutedAt":1689280387910,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"df = pd.DataFrame()\ndf[\"reviews\"] = reviews\ndf.head()"},"id":"6db73d57-5ae5-413c-a410-0331455cf6bf","cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v1+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"reviews","type":"string"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":[{"index":0,"reviews":"✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each. For us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them."},{"index":1,"reviews":"✅ Trip Verified |  This has been by far the worst service I have had on a plane. It's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. We had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. Then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments. Once we arrived at the gate, there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldn't leave the boarding area. I will never fly this airline again! "},{"index":2,"reviews":"✅ Trip Verified |  In Nov 2022 I booked and paid for a return journey to New Zealand. On my return journey my final flight was from London to Edinburgh. On trying to check in I was told my ticket ‘did not exist’. I showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a ticket. My only option was to buy a ticket for a later flight which cost £265.07. Since Nov 22, ie, 8 months ago, I have communicated multiple times with BA in an attempt to have my money returned. They have admitted responsibility for their error which cost me £265. I finally received word from them that they have decided to refund me the sum of £32.14. I have asked for an explanation but have received none, only a polite e mail informing me that the decision was checked and was correct. I do not intend to let this matter go. A company worth billions of pounds will not return an honest refund. PS, they also lost my luggage and did nothing to help me retrieve it. I tracked it down myself a week later to Edinburgh airport and picked it up myself."},{"index":3,"reviews":"Not Verified | BA is not treating its premium economy passengers with respect. You pay for a premium economy service and are then compelled to use the economy toilets at the back of the plane. This is short-changing passengers. "},{"index":4,"reviews":"✅ Trip Verified |  24 hours before our departure on BA059 to Cape Town from Heathrow on Thursday 29th June, we did an online check-in. Seats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person. The breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at all. The previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure. The seats are wide and there is ample legroom. If they can do it, then why not British Airways."}]},"total_rows":5,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"                                             reviews\n0  ✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I have flown ...\n1  ✅ Trip Verified |  This has been by far the wo...\n2  ✅ Trip Verified |  In Nov 2022 I booked and pa...\n3  Not Verified | BA is not treating its premium ...\n4  ✅ Trip Verified |  24 hours before our departu...","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>reviews</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I have flown ...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>✅ Trip Verified |  This has been by far the wo...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>✅ Trip Verified |  In Nov 2022 I booked and pa...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Not Verified | BA is not treating its premium ...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>✅ Trip Verified |  24 hours before our departu...</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"source":"import os\n\nif not os.path.exists(\"data\"):\n    os.makedirs(\"data\")\n\ndf.to_csv(\"data/BA_reviews.csv\")","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":67,"lastExecutedAt":1689280459457,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"import os\n\nif not os.path.exists(\"data\"):\n    os.makedirs(\"data\")\n\ndf.to_csv(\"data/BA_reviews.csv\")"},"id":"6b837037-e0c5-4202-9247-66bf9ded4ffc","cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"source":"Congratulations!
